  # 👋🏽 Hey, I’m Fabian Ndung’u
  
    💡 A visionary, all-rounded techie passionate about building
    intelligent systems that make a real impact.
    
    I live at the intersection of 
      **AI, Machine Learning, SoftwareDevelopment**, and 
      **Embedded Systems*
    — blending creativity with code to solve real-world problems.

## 👨🏽‍💻 Who I Am

I’m not just learning tech — I’m **living it**.

    From **training models to predict HIV trends**, to 
    **designing smart water ATMs**, to 
    **writing clean, scalable software**
    — I believe technology should *solve*, *simplify*, and *empower*.
    
    Currently, I’m sharpening my skills through hands-on projects,
    and constant curiosity
    — while laying the foundation for **...**

## 🚀 What I’ve Worked On
>🧠 Forecasted HIV Data Trends (2000–2023)

    Built ML models to analyze HIV estimates 
    and visualize country-level trends 
    using regression and clustering.


> 📱 Screen Time Pattern Analysis Among Youth

    * You’ll never guess their primary device. 🤯 
    Applied deep learning to study screen habits and
    classify health impact patterns.

> 🎓 Scholarship AI – Smart Scholarship Finder

    Created an AI-powered tool that scrapes and
    recommends scholarships 
    based on user interests, eligibility, and academic goals.

> 💧 Smart Water ATM System (Ubuntu WaterHub Africa)

    Wrote embedded C code for ATmega2560 
    to automate water control 
    with UART commands and sensor logic.

> 🛠️ Python Tools & Automations

    Created scripts for 
    data cleaning, basic analytics, and process automation
    — building blocks of smarter systems.
