# 👋🏽 Hey, I’m Fabian Ndung’u

💡 A visionary, all-rounded techie passionate about building intelligent systems that make a real impact.

I live at the intersection of  
**AI, Machine Learning, Software Development**, and  
**Embedded Systems** — blending creativity with code to solve real-world problems.

## 👨🏽‍💻 Who I Am

I’m not just learning tech — I’m **living it**.

From **training models to predict HIV trends**,  
to **designing smart water ATMs**,  
to **writing clean, scalable software** —  
I believe technology should *solve*, *simplify*, and *empower*.

Currently, I’m sharpening my skills through hands-on projects and deep curiosity,  
while laying the foundation for **a tech-driven tomorrow**.

## 🚀 What I’ve Worked On

> 🧠 **Forecasted HIV Data Trends (2000–2023)**  
> Built ML models to analyze HIV estimates and visualize country-level trends using regression and clustering.

> 📱 **Screen Time Pattern Analysis Among Youth**  
> Deep learning project uncovering device usage patterns and classifying health impacts. *(Spoiler: Smartphones dominate!)*

> 🎓 **Scholarship AI – Smart Scholarship Finder**  
> AI-powered scraper + matcher that recommends scholarships tailored to user interests and academic goals.

> 💧 **Smart Water ATM System** *(Ubuntu WaterHub Africa)*  
> Wrote embedded C code for ATmega2560 to automate water control via UART commands, sensors, and real-time logic.

> 🛠️ **Python Tools & Automations**  
> Built utilities for data cleaning, basic analytics, and automating repetitive tasks — forming the base of smarter systems.
